# steinertthrelkeldmodals

Inside a virutal env:

* `pip install -e .`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `cldfbench catconfig` and say `y` to `glottolog`
* `cldfbench makecldf cldfbench_modals.py`
* testing the IFF universal: `cldfbench modals.iff`

## TODO
* Glottolog for lang metadata
* How to best to get descriptions for each force and flavor? (This is a data-gathering question for SST; they're not in the raw data at present)
